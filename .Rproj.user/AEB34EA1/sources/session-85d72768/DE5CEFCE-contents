# ArtPalette 

`ArtPalette` is an R package designed to provide different color palettes based of famous painting. This package allows users to easily access and utilize color schemes derived from the works of renowned artists. 

## Giorgio De Chirico Palette

Giorgio de Chirico (1888-1978) was an Italian painter and a prominent figure in the metaphysical art movement, which he co-founded in the early 20th century. Born in Volos, Greece, de Chirico spent much of his childhood in Italy, where he developed a unique artistic style characterized by eerie, dreamlike landscapes and enigmatic figures. His works often feature classical architecture, long shadows, and a sense of stillness, evoking a sense of mystery and introspection.
